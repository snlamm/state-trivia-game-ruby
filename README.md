# state-trivia-game-ruby
#Multiplayer game on state trivia, such as capital cities and fun facts

# This program is a 'state quiz game' optimized for multiplayer use but also with a single-player mode
# Player(s) are asked randomly selected questions and input their answers
# The answers are checked and points are awarded for correct answers
# If a player answers incorrectly, the other player can steal the same question for bonus points
# Each question has a random chance to be a 'wildcard' question
# For a wildcard question, the player can wager the player's own points for big rewards or losses
# Safeguards are put in throughout the game to prevent common invalid inputs
# The game continues until a player has 10 points at the end of a round (or higher for a tie)
# The first player to 10 points...wins!!
